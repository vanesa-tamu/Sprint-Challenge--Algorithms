#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)  O(n) since 2 `n`s can be taken out of the function as they are repetitive. We would have one `n` variable in the while loop, so the output will increase so long as `n` (the input) increases as well.


b)  O(logn) since the inner loop with the variable `j` is being incremented by `i^2`(in essence), hence decreasing the amount of loops required to reach `n` . 

c)  O(n^2) because if the argument for `bunnies` is not 0 (which is a low probablility), then as the function recurses (until it reaches the base case of 0), then the recurssion part of the equation will add `2` to the `bunnyEars()` function. i.e. it will double the time taken to execute the function
